This code was strenuos to write and by the grace of god i was able to reach the completion of it.
I hope this will be useful to someone and i would like to invite you to take an extra step and 
accept christ as your Lord and Saviour and join me in spreading his love and grace.

Here's a short prayer for those interested:

"Lord Jesus, I come to you as a sinner, lost and condemned to Hell. I repent of my sins and ask for Your 
forgiveness. I believe with all my heart that You died for my sins on the cross and You rose again. I open 
my heart to You and recieve You as my lord and Saviour. Please take control of my life and make me what You
want me to be. From today, I am Yours and You are mine. Thank You, Father for this wonderful gift of Salvation."

God be with youmy brethren. :)
